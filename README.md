# Project 2 - Python 101

The most basic thing you can do with python is to use it as a calculator. Solve these using a python shell

1001 + 110 =
2354 + 300 =
9*2 =
(2*5)+5 =
2*(3+2) =
1 + (1/2) =
1 - (1/2) =

type() function lets you know the give python object.
Write the responses from these lines of code for example:
type("Hi") = <type 'str'>


type('hello') =
type() =
type(2) =
type(3.14) =
type([1,2,3]) =
type([1,2,3][]) =
type([1,2,3][0]) =
type([1,2,3][1]) =
type([1,2,3][3]) =
type([1,2,3][4]) =


How do you get out of a python shell?


open input_function.py and fix the errors. Make sure the code executes by running 'python input_function.py'. Once you have it working, copy and paste all the text right after the code is executed.


Finish the following code
wages = 3000
bills = 200
rent = 600
food = 200
expenses =
savings =



give the string city = 'Baltimore' write the code

to print out the 4th character in the string
